##  Quick Reference Tables

### Performance Targets
| Component | Budget | Measured | Status |
|-----------|--------|----------|--------|
| Tick-to-trade | <1μs | 70.79ns |  14x under |
| Strategy calc | <100ns | 17.28ns |  5.8x under |
| Risk validation | <50ns | 2.37ns |  21x under |
| Orderbook sync | <50ns | ~20ns |  2.5x under |

### Safety Layers
1.  Compile-time spread validation (won't compile if unprofitable)
2.  Market data validation (spread, liquidity, prices)
3.  Position limits (max 1.0 BTC)
4.  Daily loss limits (max $1,000)
5.  Circuit breaker (>10% move halts)
6.  Rate limiter (10 orders/sec)
7.  Pre-trade validation (6 checks)
8.  Kill switch (SIGUSR1)
