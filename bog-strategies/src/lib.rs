//! Bog Strategies - HFT Trading Strategy Implementations
//!
//! This crate contains zero-overhead strategy implementations using const generics.
//!
//! ## Strategies
//! - Simple Spread: Basic market making with fixed spread
//! - Inventory-Based: Avellaneda-Stoikov inventory management
//!
//! All strategies are implemented as const generic parameters rather than trait objects
//! to enable full compile-time optimization and monomorphization.

// Placeholder for now - will implement strategies next
